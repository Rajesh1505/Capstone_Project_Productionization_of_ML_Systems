        "In the realm of travel and tourism, the intersection of data analytics and machine learning presents an opportunity to revolutionize the way travel experiences are curated and delivered. This capstone project revolves around a trio of datasets - users, flights, and hotels - each providing a unique perspective on travel patterns and preferences. The goal is to leverage these datasets to build and deploy sophisticated machine learning models, serving a dual purpose: enhancing predictive capabilities in travel-related decision-making and mastering the art of MLOps through hands-on application.\n",
